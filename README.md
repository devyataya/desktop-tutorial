# Hello 

Created a script to assess service provision within a selected territory using OpenStreetMap data. Extracted territory geometry, loaded residential buildings, handled missing and inconsistent attributes, and estimated population. Loaded service locations, applied spatial buffers, and calculated a provision metric based on service accessibility.
